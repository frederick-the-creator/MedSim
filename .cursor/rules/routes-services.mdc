Routes vs Service Logic
Routes should be very thin

Route

- Parse inputs from request ( …. = req.body)
- Check auth & permissions
- Call services
- Translate results into HTTP response codes (e.g. if X, use 203)
- Handle errors and map them to HTTP response codes

Service

- Implement business rules
- Orchestrate data operations
- Be reusable - Should be able to call a service from HTTP routes, background jobs, tests, etc.
- Be framework agnostic - Should not contain Express objects like req, res, etc.
- Throw domain errors
